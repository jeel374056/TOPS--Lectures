special functionalities of constructor
it never return anything returntype nhi hota hai
we cannot give constructor name of our choice same as classname

we cannot call the constructor expilicitly but i will be called implicitly
at the time of object declaration

one object can call only one constructor at a time 

constructor when object is defined means starting of the object

it is basically used for initialization of object or we can say that values or data members
